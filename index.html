    <p>Hi! As of 16th of February 2022 Pop Microphones is closed for business.</p>
    <p>For any warranty claims, help or if you would just like to say hi, please email me at popmicrophones@gmail.com</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>On a personal note, I would like to say a big thanks to all of our customers, supporters and anyone I have interacted with over the last 4 years. </p>
    <p>it has been a big, fun journey seeing what people created with our microphone.</p>
    <p>I have closed the business to move on to new and exciting projects.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Making things is hard. If you are a creator of things, I appreciate you.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Many thanks,&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Simon Dean (founder of Pop Microphones)</p>
